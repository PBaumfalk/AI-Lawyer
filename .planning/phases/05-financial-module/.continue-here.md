<current_state>
Phase 5 planning was initiated with `/gsd:plan-phase 5`. The workflow completed initialization (Step 1), argument parsing (Step 2), phase validation (Step 3), and CONTEXT.md loading (Step 4). The researcher agent spawn (Step 5) was about to fire when work was paused.

No PLAN.md files exist yet — planning has not started.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- `/gsd:discuss-phase 5` — Complete. CONTEXT.md exists with all user decisions captured.
- Phase 4.1 — Fully complete and verified. STATE.md updated.
- Init JSON parsed — phase_dir, paths, config all resolved.
- Phase validated against ROADMAP.md — Phase 5: Financial Module confirmed.
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Step 5: Spawn gsd-phase-researcher for Phase 5 (RVG tables, ZUGFeRD toolchain, DATEV format)
- Step 6: Check existing plans (none exist)
- Step 8: Spawn gsd-planner to create PLAN.md files (05-01 through 05-05)
- Step 10: Spawn gsd-plan-checker for verification
- Steps 11-12: Handle revision loop if needed
- Step 13: Present final status
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Phase 5 requires research (research_enabled=true, has_research=false, research flag in roadmap)
- Context file exists and will be passed to all agents
- plan_checker_enabled=true — verification loop will run
- commit_docs=true — docs will be committed
- researcher_model=inherit, planner_model=inherit, checker_model=sonnet
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None. Phase 5 depends on Phase 2 (complete). Ready to proceed.
</blockers>

<context>
Phase 5 is the Financial Module — the most domain-heavy phase so far. It covers:
1. RVG fee calculator with KostBRaeG 2025 rates and Anrechnung logic
2. Invoice system with Nummernkreis, UStG §14 compliance, PDF generation
3. E-Rechnung export (XRechnung CII + ZUGFeRD PDF/A-3)
4. Aktenkonto with Fremdgeld compliance and forwarding alerts
5. DATEV CSV export, SEPA XML, bank import, Zeiterfassung

The roadmap pre-defines 5 plans (05-01 through 05-05). Research is critical for this phase due to complex German legal fee calculation rules and specific export format requirements.

Requirement IDs to cover: REQ-FI-001 through REQ-FI-011.

<next_action>
Resume with: `/gsd:plan-phase 5`
This will re-run the full workflow. Since CONTEXT.md exists and no RESEARCH.md exists yet, it will start research from scratch — which is correct since the researcher never ran.
