<current_state>
Mid-execution of /gsd:complete-milestone for v3.5 Production Ready.
CLI archived files. MILESTONES.md updated with full v3.5 entry.
Next: evolve PROJECT.md → reorganize ROADMAP.md → delete REQUIREMENTS.md → write RETROSPECTIVE.md → commit + tag v3.5.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Removed Phase 12 (Falldatenblaetter), Phase 12 (BI-Dashboard), Phase 12 (Export) → all as TODOs in .planning/todos/pending/
- Created .planning/v3.5-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md (gaps_found — 13 orphaned, intentionally deferred)
- Ran: gsd-tools milestone complete "v3.5" — archived roadmap, requirements, audit to milestones/
- MILESTONES.md: Enhanced v3.5 entry with full stats, 6 accomplishments, known gaps
- REQUIREMENTS.md still exists at .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md (needs deletion)

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

Task 5 — Evolve PROJECT.md:
- Move to Validated: BUILD-01, BUILD-02, UI-01, UI-02, UI-03 (all v3.5)
- Remove Active section items that shipped or were deferred
- Remove "Current Milestone: v3.5" section
- Update Context section (91,300 LOC, Motion/React added, UserSettings model, glass design system)
- Add v3.5 Key Decisions: glass sidebar, oklch tokens, Motion/React v11, dark mode .dark class, 4 glass tiers, SF Pro/Inter stack, date-fns Docker copy, pino-roll NEXT_PHASE guard
- Update footer: "Last updated: 2026-02-26 after v3.5 milestone"

Task 6 — Reorganize ROADMAP.md:
- Milestone line: "✅ **v3.5 Production Ready** — Phases 10-11 (shipped 2026-02-26)"
- Collapse Phase Details for 10+11 into <details> block like v3.4
- Link to milestones/v3.5-ROADMAP.md

Task 7 — Delete .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md (archived to milestones/v3.5-REQUIREMENTS.md)

Task 8 — Write RETROSPECTIVE.md (check template at /Users/patrickbaumfalk/.claude/get-shit-done/templates/retrospective.md)

Task 9 — Final commit + tag:
- git rm .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md
- Commit: "chore: complete v3.5 milestone"
- Files: MILESTONES.md, PROJECT.md, ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, RETROSPECTIVE.md + milestones/
- Tag: git tag -a v3.5 -m "v3.5 Production Ready..."
- Ask user: push tag to remote?

Task 10 — Offer /gsd:new-milestone

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- User chose "proceed anyway" with 13 orphaned requirements (all intentional scope reductions)
- 7 TODOs in .planning/todos/pending/ (4x Helena RAG, Falldatenblaetter, BI-Dashboard, Export)
- Phase 10-03 gap closure ran (VERIFICATION passed) — treat Phase 10 as complete
