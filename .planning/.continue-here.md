<current_state>
Running /gsd:complete-milestone v3.4. Pre-flight check passed (audit exists, status tech_debt, 58/58 reqs satisfied). Step 1 (verify readiness) data gathered — all 10 phases complete, 31/31 plans have SUMMARYs. Step 2 (gather stats) data gathered. Need to continue from step 2 presentation onward.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Step 0: Pre-flight check — audit found at .planning/v3.4-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md with status tech_debt, 58/58 requirements satisfied. Proceeding.
- Step 1: Verify readiness — `roadmap analyze` confirms 10 phases, 31 plans, 31 summaries, 100% progress. Phase 7 has no directory (not in milestone scope).
- Step 2: Stats gathered (not yet presented):
  - 10 phases (1, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 3, 3.1, 4, 4.1, 5, 6), 31 plans
  - 67 feat() commits
  - 85,057 lines of TypeScript
  - Timeline: 2026-02-24 to 2026-02-25 (2 days)
  - Git range: feat(01-01) through feat(06-05)
- Milestone audit committed: c0a81de (4th and final audit)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Step 2: Present stats summary to user, get confirmation
- Step 3: Extract accomplishments from SUMMARY.md one_liner fields
- Step 4: Create .planning/milestones/v3.4-ROADMAP.md archive
- Step 5: Create .planning/milestones/v3.4-REQUIREMENTS.md archive, delete REQUIREMENTS.md
- Step 6: Full PROJECT.md evolution review (read PROJECT.md, update with shipped state)
- Step 7: Run `node gsd-tools.cjs milestone complete "v3.4" --name "Kanzleisoftware"`, reorganize ROADMAP.md, delete originals
- Step 8: Git tag v3.4, commit, offer next steps
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Phase 7 (Rollen/Sicherheit) is NOT in v3.4 scope — 6 REQ-RS requirements are deferred
- Milestone status is tech_debt (not passed) — 9 tech debt items, 3 minor integration findings (INT-007/008/009)
- All 58 in-scope requirements satisfied across 3-source cross-reference
- Milestone name should be "Kanzleisoftware" (full law firm management system)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None — all data gathered, just need to continue the workflow steps

<context>
This is the complete-milestone workflow from /Users/patrickbaumfalk/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/complete-milestone.md. The workflow has 8 steps: verify_readiness, gather_stats, extract_accomplishments, create_milestone_entry (via gsd-tools), evolve_project_full_review, reorganize_roadmap, archive_milestone (via gsd-tools milestone complete), handle_branches, git_tag. Steps 1-2 data is gathered. Continue from presenting stats and moving through the remaining steps. Key files: .planning/ROADMAP.md, .planning/REQUIREMENTS.md, .planning/PROJECT.md, .planning/STATE.md, .planning/v3.4-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md.

<next_action>
Run `/gsd:complete-milestone v3.4` — resume from step 2 (present stats) through step 8 (git tag). All readiness data is already gathered. The workflow file is at /Users/patrickbaumfalk/.claude/get-shit-done/workflows/complete-milestone.md.
